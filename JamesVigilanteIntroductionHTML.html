<p>Hi! My name is James Vigilante!</p>
<br>
<p>I hope to refine my skills when it comes to this aspect of front-end development.</p>
<br>
<p>I've always had a passing interest in programming, but I didn't really fall in love with it until qurantine when I decided to use freeCodeCamp to teach myself</p>
<br>
<p>I am still deciding on whether or not I want to immediately enter the workforce with this degree or continue my education.</p>
<br>
<p>I keep a lot of reptiles and amphibians so my big dream goal is to have my own house with space for as many animals as I want.</p>
<br>
<p> Easily my favourite wiki page is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Unusual_articles" target= "_blank">This one.</a>
